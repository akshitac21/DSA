# Day 1: 02/03/22

Read about time complexiy O(1), O(n) and O(n^2) via youtube and gfg. The rest of the time complexity types will be learnt as I learn more algorithms. 
Going to start maintaining notes to revisit incase I need a quick reference.

# Day 2: 3/03/22

Learnt about other time complexities such as O(logn) based complexities and Space Time complexities
